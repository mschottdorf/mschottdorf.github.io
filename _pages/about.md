Understanding system level functions, realized by the coordinated activity of large numbers of biological elements, constitutes one of the most important and exciting challenges to science in the 21st century. A prime example are the remarkable information processing functions of the nervous system. 

In my day job, I design instrumentation and develop theoretical tools to provide insight into cooperative and dynamical aspects of nervous system function.<br />

In the night-time, I work on [open-source projects](https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.10.02.20206037v1), and try to improve the [scientific community](https://elifesciences.org/articles/21718).

**Brief CV**<br />
I completed my undergraduate education in physics and philosophy at the University of [Würzburg](https://www.physik.uni-wuerzburg.de/en/tp3/people/alumni/m-sc-manuel-schottdorf/) in Germany, supported by the [Max Weber Program](https://www.elitenetzwerk.bayern.de/en/home/funding-programs/max-weber-program). I then obtained two Master degrees, one in 2011, working in condensed matter physics from [Rutgers](http://cgisvr.physics.rutgers.edu/cgi-bin/physdb/genpip.pl?Schottdorf), and one in 2013, working in theoretical neuroscience in Göttingen. In 2018, I completed my PhD research in the labs of [Fred Wolf](https://www.uni-goettingen.de/en/58058.html) at the Max Planck Institute for Dynamics and Self-Organization and [Walter Stühmer](https://www.mpg.de/390599/experimentelle_medizin_wissM3) at the Max Planck Institute for Experimental Medicine in [Göttingen](https://www.ds.mpg.de/staff/20433). During this time, I was supported by a [Boehringer Ingelheim Fonds PhD Fellowship](https://www.bifonds.de/index.html), and I was awarded the [Otto Hahn medal](https://www.mpg.de/prizes/otto-hahn-medal) of the Max Planck Society.<br />

Since 2018, I'm a postdoc with [David Tank](https://pni.princeton.edu/faculty/david-tank) and [Carlos Brody](https://pni.princeton.edu/faculty/carlos-brody) at the [Princeton Neuroscience Institute](https://pni.princeton.edu/directory/manuel-schottdorf).
