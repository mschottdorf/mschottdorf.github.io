    excerpt: "I did my undergraduate studies in physics and philosophy at the University of Würzburg in Germany. I then obtained two Master degrees, one in 2011, working in condensed matter physics from Rutgers, and one in 2013, working in theoretical neuroscience in Göttingen. In 2018, I completed my PhD research at the Max Planck Institute for Dynamics and Self-Organization and the Max Planck Institute for Experimental Medicine in. During this time, I was supported by a Boehringer Ingelheim Fonds PhD Fellowship and I was awarded the Otto Hahn medal. I am also a recipient of a Burroughs Wellcome Career Award"
