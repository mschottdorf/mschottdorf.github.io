    title: "SuHyeong Kim, Ph.D."
    excerpt: "SuHyeong earned her Ph.D. in Neuroscience from the University of Delaware, where she was co-advised by Dr. Amy Griffin and Dr. Anna Klintsova. Her doctoral research focused on how developmental alcohol exposure alters cognitive function later in life, using in vivo electrophysiology, immunohistochemistry, and behavioral analysis. Through this work, she developed a growing interest in the complexity of neural circuits involved in memory and decision-making, particularly in how these circuits interact with external sensory inputs such as visual stimuli and perception. Outside the lab, SuHyeong enjoys photography and traveling."

    title: "Mubariz Mohammed"
    excerpt: "Mubariz began his academic journey in computer science before pivoting toward healthcare research during his master’s in Computational Data Science at UC Riverside. His work focuses on bridging machine learning and biology, with particular interest in building equitable, interpretable models in healthcare and genomics. Mubariz’s multicultural upbringing informs a research philosophy rooted in equity, curiosity, and a deep appreciation for how diverse lived experiences intersect with data and health outcomes. Beyond research, Mubariz enjoys reconnecting with nature through hiking, travelling and exploring new cuisines."

    title: "Lindsey Wang"
    excerpt: "Lindsey is a Eugene DuPont Distinguished Scholar at UD, pursuing dual degrees in electrical engineering and applied mathematics. Her current research focuses on the performance of photomultiplier tubes, a critical component in advanced microscopy. Previously, she has developed image segmentation, registration, and alignment algorithms for large-scale drone-captured images of campus and microscopic lymph node image stacks alike. She hopes to strengthen her knowledge of two-photon microscopy systems to advance various modalities of biomedical imaging while pursuing her Ph.D. In addition to scientific endeavors, Lindsey speaks three languages, plays music, and enjoys going to the gym."
