    title: "Manuel Schottdorf, Ph.D."
    excerpt: "Manuel studied physics before completing a Ph.D. at Max Planck in Germany and a Postdoc at the Princeton Neuroscience Institute. He enjoys developing scientific instrumentation and won numerous awards over the years, among them a Boehringer Ingelheim Fonds PhD Fellowship, an Otto Hahn medal, and a Burroughs Wellcome Fund's Career Award. In addition to science, Manuel's interests include labor rights and he was an organizing committee member for the postdoc union at Princeton.<br/><br/>

    title: "SuHyeong Kim, Ph.D."
    excerpt: "SuHyeong earned her Ph.D. in Neuroscience from the University of Delaware, where she was co-advised by Dr. Amy Griffin and Dr. Anna Klintsova. Her doctoral research focused on how developmental alcohol exposure alters cognitive function later in life, using in vivo electrophysiology, immunohistochemistry, and behavioral analysis. Through this work, she developed a growing interest in the complexity of neural circuits involved in memory and decision-making, particularly in how these circuits interact with external sensory inputs such as visual stimuli and perception. Outside the lab, SuHyeong enjoys photography and traveling."
