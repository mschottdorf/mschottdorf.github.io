excerpt: "The brain is the last and grandest biological frontier, the most complex thing we have yet discovered in our universe. Biological processes in the brain give rise to perception, reasoning and planning. Psychology exists, in large part, to help us understand what is behind our decisions. The Schottdorf Laboratoryâ€™s mission is to discover the basic science behind decision-making and to help link the psychology of decision making to cellular phenomena at a micro level. To do so, we use animal models.<br/><br/> Animals, too, are capable of amazing feats of perception, reasoning and planning. If you ever had mice in your kitchen, you will know what we are talking about! How do they do that? And how are these processes instantiated by the coordinated activity of single neurons?<br/><br/>
We pursue this question with mice that learn to solve complex problems in virtual reality. With the assistance of our furry colleages, we melding the sciences of animal behavior in virtual reality, neurophysiology, computation, and artificial intelligenceto explore the neural computations underlying perception. Welcome to the Schottdorf Laboratory!<br/><br/>
