Below is a brief, and slightly more technical summary of the main aspects of my work.

**Principles of neuronal computations**
The coordinated activity of neuronal activity. Low-dimensional manifolds...

key paper: Nieh, Schottdorf et al.


**Synthetic neurobiology**
We got connectomes, but cannot manipulate them effectively. There is no synthetic neurobioogy yet. I worked on that using digital phase holography, optogenetics, electrical recordings, and new instrumentation

key paper: 
J Neurosc. Methods?
PhysRev E
Lab on a Chip
 + Thesis



**Evolution, optimization principles and biophysics of the visual system**
PInwheel density,
gangllion cell mosaics
optimization principles

key paper: Plos CB
key paper: Plos ONE

biophysical model for RGC responses to natural scenes in the spirit of hodgkin and huxley.
