    excerpt: "We persue this question in mice, that we train to perform 
    complex tasks in virtual reality, while recording neural activity 
    from large numbers of cells with single-cell resolution. We make 
    sense of these data, we use techniques from machine learning and 
    AI, building on well-established theories in psychology and 
    cognitive science."
