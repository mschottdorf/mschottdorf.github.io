    excerpt: "Animals and people can learn to identify minute details from visual scenes. In humans, this is called perceptual learning. How does learned knowledge change visual processing in the brain? <br/><br/> To address this question, we persue three complimentary projects."

# Research questions
1. We will identify the role of coordinated replay between Hippocampus and Visual Cortex over learning of abstract tasks.
1. We will identify the role of top-down inputs into Visual Cortex, and how these signals change sensory responses.
1. Finally, we will explore the computational principles that use abstract and learned knowledge in sensory systems.

# Techniques we employ
