    excerpt: "Animals and people can learn to identify minute details in visual scenes, a skill that is called perceptual learning. How does learned knowledge change visual processing? To address this question, we pursue three complimentary projects:<br/><br/>1. Explore replay in Hippocampus and Neocortex over learning.<br/>2. Identify the role of top-down inputs into Visual Cortex.<br/>3. Discover the computations linking perception with knowledge."
