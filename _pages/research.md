# Some title

We also build novel tools and approaches to these questions. I have developed electrical, optical, and mechanical instrumentation, and during my PhD I have developed new methods for artifically manipulating connectomes, either by chronic patterned stimulation with LED arrays, or holography, and to assess the resulting gains and losses in function. Shown below is an overview of a holographic stimulation apparatus to produce orientation selectivity in neurons grown *in vitro*.

I also believe that it important to continuously improve the scientific culture as a whole, and to fulfill our responsibility as scientists to society. For example, I have worked on the identification of gender bias in the scientific community. I participate in community outreach, for example judging elementary school science or science festivals; the most recently the Philly Science Festival. During the Covid-19 pandemic, I have developed open-source medical technology. I also write (mostly anonymously) for Wikipedia.
