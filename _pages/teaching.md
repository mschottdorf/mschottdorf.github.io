**Of general use**

I'm not teaching at the moment, but some of these projects originated in the context of teaching and might be of general use:

1. I've built a [latex thesis template](https://github.com/mschottdorf/Thesis-template) that might be useful for some.

2. Various [Teaching code](https://github.com/mschottdorf/TeachingCode), for example simulating SK spin glasses, neural networks, machine learning models etc.
