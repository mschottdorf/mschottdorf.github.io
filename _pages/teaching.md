**Of general use**

I'm not teaching at the moment, but some of these projects originated in the context of teaching and might be of general use:

1. I've built a [latex thesis template](https://github.com/mschottdorf/Thesis-template) that might be useful for some.

2. An event-based neural network simulator for the arduino called [Spikeduino](https://github.com/mschottdorf/Spikeduino).


**Past events**

1. Supervision of 1 Master student (physics) and 12 lab rotation students (neuroscience), University Göttingen (2013-2017)
2. Organized: **Physics of neuronal plasticity** Dept. Physics, University Göttingen (Summer 2015)
3. Organized: **Advanced Python programming course**, European Neuroscience Institute, Göttingen (Summer 2015)
4. Organized: **Information theory in dynamical systems**, Dept. Physics, University Göttingen (Winter 2014/2015)
5. Organized: **Physics of vision**, Dept. Physics, University Göttingen (Winter 2013/2014)
6. TA'd: **Statistics and thermodynamics**, Dept. Physics University Würzburg (Winter 2011/2012)
7. TA'd: **Computational physics**, Dept. Physics University Würzburg (Winter 2009/2010)


2. Fitting an LSTM to Tycho Brahe's Mars data.

3. Experimenting with Hopfield Networks:
    Counting the number of metastable states of the SK spin glass model (Tanakat and Edwards 1980)
    Fraction of correctly classified patters for a perceptron of length N und load alpha
    Fraction of correctly remembered attractors in a Hopfield network of size N and load alpha 

4. Lyapunov spectrum of the lorenz attractor.

4. A set of lecture notes from the 2016 Computational Neuroscience Summer Course in Göttingen, taken from Vijay Balasubramanian's *"The Maps Inside Your Head"*
